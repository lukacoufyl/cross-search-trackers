# cross-search-trackers
cross search movies/tv series accross some torrent trackers using imdb id

---
this is learning experience for me. i have no idea about js. trying to write a userscript from looking through some one or two other scripts.

i spend a whole lot of my time searching across trackers and checking whose release got where. this script is an attempt to make that happen with ease.

im not gonna bother making it work with all the trackers, just the ones i would like to have.

### for now it will contain:
1. PTP
2. BHD
3. HDT
4. FL
5. RARBG

i will try my naive aproach to add as many pages with imdb IDs as i can to integrate with this. lets begin.
